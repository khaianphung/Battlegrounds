This document is to help maintain the Git. If you have questions for uploading files, refer to this first, or ask me(Kevin). Iâ€™d rather not have to roll-back to recover a working build.

*UPLOAD TO THE TESTING BRANCH FIRST*
If you think that your code is going to break something, make a new branch.

Each branch you make should have a version number rather than testing/beta.

If you think that the code you added is working, create a pull request from your version of the branch to the testing/beta branch. The master should only be used for working versions of the project.
