This document is to help maintain the Git. If you have questions for uploading files, refer to this first, or ask me(Kevin). Iâ€™d rather not have to roll-back to recover a working build.

*UPLOAD TO THE TESTING BRANCH FIRST*
If you think that your code is going to break something, make a new branch.

Each branch you make should have a version number rather than testing/beta.

If you think that the code you added is working, create a pull request from your version of the branch to the testing/beta branch. The master should only be used for working versions of the project.

Using the GitHub client:
  - Make sure that you have the testing/beta branch selected
    - You can check this from the changes tab, if it says commit to testing/beta, you're in the right one
  - Remember to sync your changes
  - Create new branches off of the testing branch
  - Pull requests are not automatic, they need to be approved before they happen
  - If you see a request, and the current build has not been tested, test it
  - Do not approve your own pull requests, have at least one other person verify the build before it is pushed to the master
